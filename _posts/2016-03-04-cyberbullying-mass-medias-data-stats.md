## Discerning Cyberbullying

While all the world is talking about cyberbullying , we need to discern the reality (numbers) from the perception (what we think about).
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120806093942.htm" target="_blank">A research by Dan Olweus</a>, PhD, of the University of Bergen, Norway, tells us that Cyberbullying in the USA is less frequent than the Traditional Bullying.
In the sample of the research _&#8220;an average of 18 percent of students said they had been verbally bullied, while about 5 percent said they had been cyberbullied&#8221;_.
While asking the young whether they had been cyberbullied or not may be a weak research tool (we can argue some teens hadn&#8217;t the courage to expose themselves), the result is still worth considering.
Not only: other analysis showed that **80 percent to 90 percent of cyberbullied students were also exposed to traditional forms of bullying.**

## Cyberbullying only rarely the sole factor identified in teen suicides.

<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121020162615.htm" target="_blank">A research presented on Oct. 20 2012</a>, at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) National Conference and Exhibition in New Orleans, shows us a more complex pattern.
In 41 suicide cases identified by the research &#8220;78 percent of adolescents who committed suicide were bullied both at school and online, and only 17 percent were targeted online only&#8221;.
**There&#8217;s also a correlation with mental disease:** _&#8220;A mood disorder was reported in 32 percent of the teens, and #depression symptoms in an additional 15 percent.&#8221;_ These numbers show us that Cyberbullying is just a piece of a huge puzzle.

## So Are Cyberbullying and Bullying the same?

They are two pieces of the same pattern, yet <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120413122202.htm" target="_blank">they&#8217;re not the same.</a> Traditional Bullying ( Schoolyard Bullying) is associated with 3 characteristics:

  * a power differential between bully and victim
  * a proactive targeting of a victim
  * ongoing aggression

and 3 roles:

  * victim
  * bully
  * witness

While in Traditional Bullying these roles are rigid, in Cyberbullying they are more fluid, so that lot of times the same teenager may act all of these roles.

## What can we do to fix the problem?

Although Cyberbullying and Bullying are different, **they must be treated as parts of the same system.**
The programs used to prevent Traditional Bullying are useless in Cyberbullying because teenagers don&#8217;t equate them: they usually downplay Cyberbullying.
We need new tools, maybe **2.0 tools?**
What do you think about it?
