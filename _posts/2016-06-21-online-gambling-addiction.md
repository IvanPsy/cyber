## Endless Games may be the door to Online Gambling Addiction.

In this video I explain the other side of the coin: **Endless Games may be the door to Online Gambling.**

It all starts with a [neurosciences research:](http://goo.gl/iGPMIP) a group of researchers took a group of rats and created an action-reward system: the more the reward, the more the risk and the less the chance to win the prize.

They added lights and sound.

After a period of training, the rats acted in a very rational way: they preferred low but more probable rewards.

Then researchers made the lights brighter and brighter and the sound louder and louder.

**The result:** the more the brightness and the volume, the more rats acted high-risk behaviors, though the chance to win was lower.

This means that Online Gambling Addiction starts as a will of the Mind, but **soon become an arc reflex mediated by dopamine,** the pleasure substance.

**Endless Games may be the door to Online Gambling Addiction.**

They have poor gameplay, continuous flow of small rewards, lights and sounds.
The same as slot machines!

This means a continuous release of a small amount of dopamine, that may create addiction.
